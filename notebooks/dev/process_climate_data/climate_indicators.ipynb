    "# Climate indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook titled climate_indicators.ipynb from the FAIRiCUBE Urban Climate Use Case repository focuses on computing and analyzing climate-related indicators for European cities. It serves as a foundational step in understanding urban climate dynamics, which is essential for informed urban planning and climate adaptation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to break down different climate indicators.\n",
    "The datasource are ERA-5 Data on:\n",
    "https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-datasets/era5?hl=de\n",
    "\n",
    "We use this data source because the data is available there in an analysis ready cloud-optimised format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected climate indices are:\n",
    "- Number of summer days\n",
    "- Number of tropical nights\n",
    "- 2m temperature statistics (mean, std, min, max)\n",
    "- total precipitation (mean, std, min, max)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to:\n",
    "- Access Climate Data: Retrieve gridded climate datasets, such as temperature and humidity, from sources like the Copernicus Climate Data Store.\n",
    "- Compute Climate Indicators: Calculate various climate indicators, including:\n",
    "    - Average annual temperature\n",
    "    - Number of summer days (e.g., days with temperatures above 25°C)\n",
    "    - Number of tropical nights (e.g., nights with temperatures above 20°C)\n",
    "    - Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) metrics\n",
    "- Spatial Analysis: Aggregate and analyze these indicators at the city level, aligning with urban boundaries to provide city-specific insights.\n",
    "- Data Integration: Prepare the computed indicators for integration with other datasets, such as socio-economic or land use data, facilitating comprehensive urban climate assessments."
